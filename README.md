This program implements four numerical methods for approximating denite integrals: Trapezoid Rule, Simpson's 1/3 Rule, Simpson's 3/8 Rule, and Boole's Rule, to estimate the value of pi. By divvying up the interval of integration into smaller pieces, we obtain more accurate estimates. The output of the program tabulates the errors from the methods described above.
